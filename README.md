# GEC-sem-2-Test
# My Project
This is a readMeFile shows the usage of me using the readmeFile and to breifly explain what this project is about. I created this project as it was part of the assignment and my task was to create a mario game. In this case it followed the original aracde style game and so i created a project using the ideas from that. This project is done using C++ with SDL and it was done on visual studio. Making a change for the project can be easily done in cinch by using github and the various of branches help keeping track of the project works nicely!
